## 10.1 Hot keyed messages while playing

While playing multi player games, you can set the four keys F9 - F12 to have four special messages that you can send to the other players in the game. This could be good for messages that you need to send quickly while fighting. To change these messages on a PC, you should edit the files *diablo.ini* in Diablo and *hellfire.ini* in Hellfire. For Hellfire, you must first create the file. The easiest way to do this is to copy the *diablo.ini* file from your Diablo folder into the Hellfire folder and then rename it. The syntax of the two files is identical.
