## 10.2 Save files

In single player, you can save (and must save) your game whenever you want. The save files are stored in the Diablo/Hellfire folder and can easily be transferred to other computers. In multi player, you canâ€™t save the game. Your character, its stats and items that it has equipped or carries, is saved automatically by the game as soon as you make any changes to it. Thus, there is never any need to save it. Your character in multi player is also saved in the Diablo folder. The names of the save files are summarized in the tables below. In versions previous to 1.08, the game used to save your multiplayer files in the Windows (!) folder on the PC, so you may still find those save files there. Whenever you run Diablo v1.08 or later, it will move those files to the Diablo folder but will not remove them from the Windows folder. As Hellfire is based on the 1.04 version of Diablo, it still saves the multiplayer files in the Windows folder.
