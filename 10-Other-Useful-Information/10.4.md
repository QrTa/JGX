## 10.4 Backing up your character

In case you are worried of losing your character due to crashes or other computer problems, the easiest way to back up your character is to simply copy the save files to a safe place (a floppy disk for example). To restore it later, you simply copy the save file back to the proper folder. See chapter 10.2 for more information about the save files and where they are located.
