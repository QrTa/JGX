## 10.6 Avoiding the Game End movie

Every time you or someone else kill Diablo, the game will end and the Game End movie will start to play. As the movie is quite long, it is worth using the following way to terminate it before it reaches the end. As soon as it starts, press Alt-Tab. This will bring you out to your Windows desktop. Now either press Alt-Tab again until you get back to Diablo, or click on Diablo on the Task Bar. You will then be back to the Battle.net chat room or the pre-game menu, depending on what type of game you were playing.

An alternative is to rename (or move) the file *Smackw32.dll* found in your Diablo folder. It is the file that plays the movies in the game. It will also result in that you wwill not be able to see the introduction movies though. It seems the game will not be affected in any other way if you rename or move this file but be aware that if you get into any trouble, you may have to reinstall the game. If you do this, pay attention to the Daylight-saving time problem mentioned in chapter 10.5.
