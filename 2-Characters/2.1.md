## 2.1 Character stats

Each character in Diablo has a set of stats (or abilities) that greatly affect how well he or she performs. This chapter will explain how these stats affect your character, how they are calculated (which is not always obvious as the game often does not show the true values of the stats), and how they can be changed. For information about how items can modify the stats, see chapter 3. The stats have been grouped into basic stats (Strength, Magic, Dexterity, Vitality, Life and Mana) and other stats (Armor Class, To Hit, Damage and Resistance). The final stat, character level, is handled in chapter 2.6. One should be aware of the fact that the clvl of a character is in fact the most important stat of them all as it enters into the calculations of many of the other stats as can be seen in this chapter.

### 2.1.1 Starting stats

Each character class has its own starting values for the basic stats. They are listed below. Also listed are which stats are increased and by how much when you gain a level. Apart from those, you also gain 5 ”points” to distribute among your four main stats until they have reached their maximum value. Shrines and some monsters have the ability to alter your stats, too. See appropriate chapters for more information.

| **Class**    | **Strength** | **Magic** | **Dexterity** | **Vitality** | **Life** | **Mana** | **Effect of Level<sup>[^1]</sup>** |
|-------------|:-----------:|----------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:--------:|---------:|:-----------------:|
| **Warrior**   | 30  | 10  | 20  | 25  | 70  | 10  | +2 life, +1 mana  |
| **Rogue**     | 20  | 15  | 30  | 20  | 45  | 22  | +2 life, +2 mana  |
| **Sorcerer**  | 15  | 35  | 15  | 20  | 30  | 70  | +1 life, +2 mana  |
| **Monk**      | 25  | 15  | 25  | 20  | 45  | 22  | +2 life, +2 mana  |
| **Bard**      | 20  | 20  | 25  | 20  | 45  | 35  | +2 life, +2 mana  |
| **Barbarian** | 40  |  0  | 20  | 25  | 70  |  0  | +2 life, +0 mana<sup>[^2]</sup>  |

[^1]: You don’t get any life or mana when gaining level 50.  
[^2]: The Barbarian also gets 1% resistance per level.

### 2.1.2 Maximum stats

When your stats turn golden they have reached their maximum value and can only be increased by wearing items that increases them further (life and mana never turn golden). The table below lists the maximum stats for each character class assuming a naked character. Note that you don’t get any life or mana when you gain level 50.

| **Class**     | **Max Strength** | **Max Magic** | **Max Dexterity** | **Max Vitality** | **Max Life** | **Max Mana** |
|--------------|---------------:|-------------:|---------------:|---------------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| **Warrior**   | 250 | 50  | 60  | 100 | 316 | 98  |
| **Rogue**     | 55  | 70  | 250 | 80  | 201 | 173 |
| **Sorcerer**  | 45  | 250 | 85  | 80  | 138 | 596 |
| **Monk**      | 150 | 80  | 150 | 80  | 201 | 183 |
| **Bard**      | 120 | 120 | 120 | 100 | 221 | 231 |
| **Barbarian** | 255 | 0  | 55  | 150 | 416 | 0  |


The table below also shows the maximum stats, but this time when equipped with items that give the maximum stat increase. Note that it is *not* possible to reach those maximum values all at once. When two numbers are given the first one belongs to Diablo and the second one to Hellfire. The reason for this is the use of four new unique rings only available in Hellfire. It does *not* take into account the possibility of the use of two new unique jewelry in Hellfire that move life to/from mana.

| **Class**   | **Max Strength** | **Max Magic** | **Max Dexterity** | **Max Vitality** | **Max Life**  | **Max Mana**  |
|------------|:---------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|-------------:|-------------:|
| **Warrior**  | 425 / 485       | 225 / 285    | 225 / 285      | 265 / 325      | 796 / 916    | 533 / 568    |
| **Rogue**    | 230 / 290       | 245 / 305    | 415 / 475      | 245 / 305      | 681 / 741    | 690 / 718    |
| **Sorcerer** | 220 / 280       | 425 / 485    | 250 / 310      | 245 / 305      | 618 / 618    | 1196 / 1216  |
| **Monk**     | 385             | 315          | 375            | 305            | 741          | 728          |
| **Bard**     | 370             | 360          | 360            | 340            | 761          | 865          |
| **Barbarian**| 490             | 235          | 280            | 375            | 1091         | 470          |

### 2.1.3 Life and mana

Life is based on vitality while mana is based on magic. To calculate how much life and mana you have, use the formulas listed below.

| **Class**     | **Formula for Life Calculation**                                      | **Bonus** |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------:|
| **Warrior**   | `(2 × Vit`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (2 × Vit`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (2 × clvl) + Life`<sub>`items`</sub>  | +18  |
| **Rogue**     | `(1 × Vit`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (1.5 × Vit`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (2 × clvl) + Life`<sub>`items`</sub> | +23  |
| **Sorcerer**  | `(1 × Vit`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (1 × Vit`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (1 × clvl) + Life`<sub>`items`</sub>  | +9   |
| **Monk**      | `(1 × Vit`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (1.5 × Vit`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (2 × clvl) + Life`<sub>`items`</sub> | +23  |
| **Bard**      | `(1 × Vit`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (1.5 × Vit`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (2 × clvl) + Life`<sub>`items`</sub> | +23  |
| **Barbarian** | `(2 × Vit`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (2.5 × Vit`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (2 × clvl) + Life`<sub>`items`</sub> | +18  |

| **Class**     | **Formula for Mana Calculation**                                      | **Bonus** |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------:|
| **Warrior**   | `(1 × Mag`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (1 × Mag`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (1 × clvl) + Mana`<sub>`items`</sub>  | -1  |
| **Rogue**     | `(1 × Mag`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (1.5 × Mag`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (2 × clvl) + Mana`<sub>`items`</sub> | +5  |
| **Sorcerer**  | `(2 × Mag`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (2 × Mag`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (2 × clvl) + Mana`<sub>`items`</sub>  | -2  |
| **Monk**      | `(1 × Mag`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (1.5 × Mag`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (2 × clvl) + Mana`<sub>`items`</sub> | +5  |
| **Bard**      | `(1.5 × Mag`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (1.75 × Mag`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (2 × clvl) + Mana`<sub>`items`</sub> | +3  |
| **Barbarian** | `(1 × Mag`<sub>`character`</sub>`) + (1 × Mag`<sub>`items`</sub>`) + (0 × clvl) + Mana`<sub>`items`</sub> | +0  |

- Black Deaths (a zombie type of monster) can permanently decrease your life.
- You do not get any mana or life when reaching level 50 (use clvl=49 to get the correct result).
- Some shrines might permanently decrease your max mana (see chapter 5.6.5).
- If you are on level 16, you will not lose any of your items when you die.

### 2.1.4 Armor Class and To Hit

Both Armor Class (AC) and To Hit are based on your Dexterity. Below is a summary on how they are calculated. For more information about AC and To Hit, see chapter 5.6.5.

| **Armor Class Calculation** | **Formula** |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Warrior, Rogue, Sorcerer** | `(Dex ÷ 5) + AC`<sub>`items`</sub> |
| **Monk with Plate Armor** | `(Dex ÷ 5) + AC`<sub>`items`</sub> |
| **Monk with Mail Armor** | `(Dex ÷ 5) + AC`<sub>`items`</sub>` + (clvl ÷ 2)` |
| **Monk with Light Armor (Leather, etc.)** | `(Dex ÷ 5) + AC`<sub>`item`s`</sub>` + (2 × clvl)` |
| **Monk with No Armor** | `(Dex ÷ 5) + AC`<sub>`items`</sub>` + (2 × clvl)` |
| **Bard** | `(Dex ÷ 5) + AC`<sub>`items`</sub> |
| **Barbarian** | `(Dex ÷ 5) + AC`<sub>`items`</sub>` + (clvl ÷ 4)` |


- When calculating AC for a Monk, unique plate is treated as mail and unique mail as leather.
- Shields only give half AC (rounded up) to the Barbarian.


| **To Hit % Calculation** | **Formula** | **Notes** |
|-------------------------|-------------|------|
| **Character Screen** | `50 + (Dex ÷ 2) + ToHit`<sub>`items`</sub> | Displayed on the in-game character screen. |
| **Melee Attack** | `50 + (Dex ÷ 2) + ToHit`<sub>`items`</sub>` + clvl + bonus` | Used for melee combat calculations. |
| **Ranged Attack (Arrows)** | `50 + Dex + ToHit`<sub>`items`</sub>` + clvl + bonus - (distance² ÷ 2)` | Distance-based penalty applies. |
| **Magic vs Monster** | `50 + Mag - (2 × mlvl) + bonus` | Spell accuracy against monsters. |
| **Magic vs Player** | `50 + Mag - (2 × clvl<sub>target</sub>) + bonus` | Spell accuracy against other players. |
| **To Hit Penalty for Adjacent Quarter Damage** | `70 - (2 × clvl)` | Minimum value: 30. |


- All magic attacks will always check for To Hit, even for spells like Lightning and Fire Wall.
- A player is immune to its own spells with the exception of Fire Wall and Flame Wave.
- Fire Wall, Flame Wave and Ring of Fire will check for To Hit like magical traps against players including the caster (but not against monsters). See chapters 4.3 and 6.1.2.
- Distance is actually a time count. It goes up by 1 twenty times each second. Arrows always have a distance factor, even if they have extra fire or lightning. For more information see chapters 4.1.2.
- Note that the effects of some oils (see chapter 3.2.1) are only visible on the stats in the character screen. They don’t show up on the information about the item.
- In Diablo, the *bashing* series of suffixes also adds to your To Hit value but it will never show up on the character screen. The amount is always fixed for a specific item and within the range of the suffix. See chapter 3.4 for more information.
- The adjacent quarter damage To Hit penalty is subtracted from the normal To Hit for the two monsters adjacent to the one you attack. For an explanation of adjacent quarter damage see chapter 2.2.2.
- For a list of the bonuses, see the table below.
- To get the final chance of hitting you subtract the AC of the enemy (monster or player). See chapter 5.1 for information about monster’s AC. The AC is not subtracted if it is a magic attack.
- When the game checks if you have hit there is always a 5% chance that you will miss, no matter what the final modified To Hit is. In the same way there is also always a 5% chance to hit, no matter what the final modified To Hit is. See chapter 5.1 for information about monster’s chance of automatic hit (they never automatically miss).

The bonus in the above formulas refers to some *hidden* To Hit modifiers specific for each character class. They are listed in the table below but do not show up in the To Hit value you see on the character screen. For the blocking bonus see chapter 2.2.

| **Class**      | **Melee** | **Arrow** | **Magic** | **Blocking<sup>[^3]</sup>** |
|--------------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------:|
| **Warrior**   | 20      | 10      | -       | 30        |
| **Rogue**     | -       | 20      | -       | 20        |
| **Sorcerer**  | -       | -       | 20      | 10        |
| **Monk**      | -       | -       | -       | 25        |
| **Bard**      | -       | 10      | 10      | 25        |
| **Barbarian** | -       | -       | -       | 30        |

[^3]: There exists a bug where the **blocking bonus is always 0**, except during the first game a character plays.


In the table below, maximum AC and To Hit for each character class is summarized. The columns for max values from max stats are maximum values without the use of any items that specifically add to AC and To Hit (only to Dex). When two numbers are given the first one belongs to Diablo and the second one to Hellfire. The reason is that there are some new unique rings only available in Hellfire. It also excludes any effects from oils and shrines that directly affect AC or To Hit. The values are, of course, excluding such things as clvl that is factored in for computing the real final To Hit.

| **Class**      | **Max AC Naked** | **Max To Hit Naked** | **Max AC from Maxed Stats** | **Max To Hit from Maxed Stats** | **Max AC** | **Max To Hit** |
|--------------|----------------:|------------------:|----------------------:|--------------------------:|---------:|------------:|
| **Warrior**   | 12               | 80               | 45 / 57               | 162 / 192                 | 349 / 401 | 392        |
| **Rogue**     | 50               | 175              | 83 / 95               | 257 / 287                 | 385 / 425 | 487        |
| **Sorcerer**  | 17               | 92               | 50 / 62               | 175 / 205                 | 350 / 390 | 405        |
| **Monk**      | 130<sup>[^4]</sup>         | 125              | 175<sup>[^4]</sup>              | 237                        | 419       | 437        |
| **Bard**      | 24               | 110              | 72                     | 230                        | 413       | 565        |
| **Barbarian**     | 23<sup>[^4]</sup>      | 77               | 56                     | 190                        | 370       | 390        |
