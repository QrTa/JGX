## 2.3 Timing information

This chapter summarizes all timing information for players. For blocking and hit recovery, this information can also be found in chapter 2.2, and for weapon speed, it can also be found in chapter 2.2.3. For monsters all timing information can be found in chapter 5.3. The table below summarizes all timing information for the different character classes.

[^13]: For more information, see chapter **2.2**.  
[^14]: The **hit time** (or rather the time at which the spell effect is initialized) for a player is identical to the **swing speed** (that is, at the last frame) except for **non-targeted spells** (those for which you donâ€™t target a specific monster or player) which have a **0.05 seconds faster hit time**.  
[^15]: The swing speed is of course the one for **casting a spell**.  
[^16]: The **Barbarian** has built-in *stability* while using an **axe** or a **club**, unless wearing an item that affects **hit recovery** in a better way.
