## 2.4 Skills

Each character class has a skill it can perform. For most classes, the skill improves as they gain levels. The various skills are summarized below.

| **Class**     | **Skill**            | **Effect**  |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Warrior**   | Repair Items         | Durability loss decreases as level increases. |
| **Rogue**     | Disarm Traps         | Success chance increases with higher Dexterity. |
| **Sorcerer**  | Recharge Staves      | Charge loss decreases as level increases. |
| **Monk**      | Search               | Reveals nearby objects and hidden doors. |
| **Bard**      | Identify             | Allows identification of items. |
| **Barbarian** | Rage                 | Stat boost increases with level, but so do penalties during lethargy. |

**Warrior**

The skill of the Warrior works in the following way:

### **Item Repair Formula**
1. **If** current durability is equal to max durability, **exit**.
2. **Set** `x = 0`
3. **Add** `(clvl + Rnd[clvl])` to `x`
4. **Calculate** `y = [MaxDur / (clvl + 9)]`, **if** `y < 1`, **set** `y = 1`
5. **Decrease** `MaxDur` by `y`
6. **If** `x + CurDur < MaxDur`, **goto step 3**.
7. **Set** `CurDur = MaxDur`

If max durability ever reaches 0, the item is of course destroyed.

**Rogue**

The skill of the Rogue works in the following way:

### **Trap Disarm Formula**
1. **Calculate** `x = (2 × Dex) - (5 × dlvl)`
2. **If** `x > Rnd[100]`, **trap is disarmed**

**Sorcerer**

The skill of the Sorcerer works in the following way:

### **Staff Recharge Formula**
1. **If** `CurChrg` (current charges) **is equal to** `MaxChrg` **or** `MaxChrg` **is 0**, **exit**.
2. **Calculate** `x = Rnd[clvl / qlvl(book)] + 1`
3. **Decrease** `MaxChrg` by `1`
4. **Add** `x` to `CurChrg`
5. **If** `CurChrg < MaxChrg`, **go to** Step 3.
6. **Set** `CurChrg = MaxChrg`

It seems strange that it is not the qlvl of the spell on a staff, and I wonder what happens for a spell like resurrect where the qlvl value is -1. Any information about this is appreciated.

**Monk**

The skill of the Monk is identical to the spell with the same name.

**Bard**

The skill of the Bard is identical to the spell with the same name.

**Barbarian**

The skill of the Barbarian works in the following way:

### **Rage Formula**
1. **For 12 seconds**, gain:
   - `+ (2 × clvl)` to **Strength** and **Vitality**
   - `+ (1.5 × clvl)` to **Dexterity**
2. **For the next 12 seconds** (lethargy phase), **lose** the **same** amount from **Strength, Dexterity, and Vitality** (calculated from normal values).
3. **Afterwards**, lose `(2 × Vit)` **life**.
   - 🐞 **Bug:** Clicking any item in your inventory **restores** lost life.
