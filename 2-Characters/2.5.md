## 2.5 Starting equipment

All character classes start the game with some items. These items are listed in the table below. Note that the prices for these items sometimes differ from the ones of normal items of the same type. The sword that the Bard starts with seems not to be available otherwise in the game.

[^17]: These starting staves are special in that they are *not* composed of a staff with a spell on it, but are unique base items that have the spell built into them. The prices listed are for these base items, and no additional cost is added for the spell itself.
