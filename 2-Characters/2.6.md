## 2.6 Experience points

Each time you kill a monster you have a chance of receiving experience points. You receive experience for killing a monster as long as your own level is below the mlvl+10 (see chapter 5.2 and 5.6.3 for more information about mlvl and experience points). In multi player, each person that fulfills one of following requirements is entitled to receive experience points when a monster is killed.

- Killing the monster (both in melee and with spell).
- Dealing damage to the monster in either melee or with a bow (regardless of any extra fire or lightning damage even if the monster is resistant or immune to it).
- Dealing damage to the monster with a spell to which the monster is *not* resistant or immune.
- Having your golem kill or deal damage to the monster.
- Having used Telekinesis on the monster (Snotspill, Gharbad the Weak, Zhar the Mad, Warlord of Blood, Lachdanan, Arch-Bishop Lazarus, Blackjade and Red Vex are all immune to Telekinesis though).

In all cases you must be alive at the moment the monster dies and you must never have left the level in-between fulfilling any of the requirements above and the monster dying, or you will not receive any experience points. The requirement of dealing damage is fulfilled even if for some reason the damage itself is reduced to below 1 point of damage (theoretically even 0 damage will be enough). Stone Cursing a monster will *not* be enough to receive any experience points. A Guardian is treated as a normal fire spell for the purpose of deciding if the owning player is entitled to experience points. In Hellfire a Berserk monster will *not* give you experience points for the other monsters it kills.

In single player you are then rewarded the amount of experience points according to the formula below. In multi player the same formula applies, but the base experience points of the monster are first divided by the number of players that are entitled to receive experience points, which is not necessarily all players in the game.

`base × (1.0 + 0.1×(mlvl - clvl))`

So when your clvl is 10 levels higher than the mlvl, you no longer receive any experience for killing it. *Base* refers to the base experience points found in chapter 5.2 modified for the number of players that are entitled for experience points according to the explanation above.

The maximum experience you can obtain for killing a monster in multi player (both in Diablo and Hellfire) is 200×clvl or the total experience points needed for advancing to the next clvl divided by 20, whichever is the lowest. In single player there is no such a cap. With the added possibility of difficulty levels in single player in Hellfire along with no character level requirements for harder difficulty levels, you can get quite a lot of experience points when killing monsters. In Hellfire, there are also some shrines that affect your experience points (see chapter 7).

Listed below are the required experience points for each level. You will also find the maximum experience point you can be given for a monster at that character level (see above for information about this cap). Listed is also the minimum number of monsters you need to kill to reach the next level assuming you get maximum experience for each kill. This is in practice impossible and even theoretically impossible at low levels. The *Total Kills* column is simply the total minimum number of monsters needed to kill to reach a specific level and is valid for Diablo only as there is no limit on the number of experience points given for killing a monster in Hellfire. Note that the numbers under *Increase*, *Increase %, Kills,* and *Total Kills* are all how much is needed for the *next* level.

[^18]: This cap only applies to multiplayer. In single-player, there is no such cap.


Note that when you reach level 50, you don’t get any life or mana. Your other stats are updated correctly, though. After reaching level 50, you still receive experience points for killing monsters until you reach enough experience points for MAX (see below). Reaching MAX has no effect at all (apart from not being able to get any more experience of course).
