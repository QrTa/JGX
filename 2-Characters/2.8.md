## 2.8 Character names

When you create a character, you also have to give it a name. Depending on if it is a single or multi player character, the characters that are allowed to use in the name differ slightly. The table below summarize all allowed characters.

| **Game Type**  | **Allowed Characters in Name** |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Any  | 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ |
| Single Player | `!@$(){}[]=+`~^-’.:;\_|”#%&/?\*,<> SPACE` + localized characters<sup>[^22]</sup> |
| Multi Player  | `!@$(){}[]=+`~^-’.:;\_|` |

[^22]: By "localized characters," we mean characters specific to **various non-English languages**. Examples include: **å, ä, ö, ü, â, ã, ï**, and many others.  
These characters can still be entered when creating a character, but an **error message** will appear upon finalizing the name.
