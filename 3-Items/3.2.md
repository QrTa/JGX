## 3.2 Other base items

This chapter will give you information about all those items in the game that you can’t wear. It also has information about magic related items. However, for information about the actual spells, how they work and their use, see chapter 4. Books and most oils consist of a base item type, *book of* and *oil of* listed in the table below. Each book then has a spell assigned to it and oils have an oil type assigned.


### Books & Oils

| **Type**       | **Price** | **qlvl** |
|---------------|---------:|--------:|
| Book of       |    -     | 2, 8, 14, 20 |
| Oil of        |    -     | 10 |


### 3.2.1 Runes and oils

Runes and oils were introduced in Hellfire and do not exist in Diablo. Runes are placed in the dungeons and when a monster or player walks over them the spell is released. They can also be used directly on a target. Oils are used on items to boost their properties. Note that only effects from oils that affect the durability are carried over when you start a new game.

### Runes

| **Rune<sup>[^37]</sup>** | **Cost** | **qlvl** | **Effect<sup>[^38]</sup>** | **Requirement** |
|----------------------|--------:|--------:|------------------|--------------|
| Rune of Fire        | 100     | 1      | Casts Fireball   | No requirement |
| Rune of Lightning   | 200     | 3      | Casts Lightning Wall | Requires 13 Magic |
| Rune of Stone       | 300     | 7      | Casts Stone Curse | Requires 25 Magic |
| Greater Rune of Fire | 400    | 7      | Casts Immolation | Requires 42 Magic |
| Greater Rune of Lightning | 500 | 7    | Casts Nova | Requires 42 Magic |

[^37]: **Runes** can be found in the dungeon or bought from **Adria**.
[^38]: The runes **do not cast the exact spell** but rather a **similar version**. The **player’s level affects the damage/duration** of the runes.

Oils might need some more explanation. They are created by the game in two different ways. You won’t see that as a player and there is actually no difference in how they work depending on how they were created. The first three oils in the list below actually exist as a single base item. All other oils, including also versions of the first three ones, are created as a base item *oil of* to which an oil type is then assigned, just like spell books. They are listed below the thick line.

### Oils

| **Oil<sup>[^39]</sup>** | **Cost** | **qlvl** | **Effect<sup>[^40]</sup>** |

[^44]: **All item requirements** are lowered by the **same amount**.  


### 3.2.2 Potions and elixirs

The tables below hold information about potions and elixirs. As always, the prices are buying prices.

### Potions

| **Potion** | **Cost** | **qlvl** | **Effect** |
|-----------|--------:|--------:|-----------|
| Potion of Healing<sup>[^45]</sup> | 50 | 1 | Restores some of your life |
| Potion of Full Healing | 150 | 1 | Restores all of your life |
| Potion of Mana<sup>[^45]</sup> | 50 | 1 | Restores some of your mana |
| Potion of Full Mana | 150 | 1 | Restores all of your mana |
| Potion of Rejuvenation<sup>[^45]</sup> | 120 | 3 | Restores some of your life and mana |
| Potion of Full Rejuvenation | 600 | 7 | Restores all of your life and mana |

[^45]: See below for information on how much **life/mana** is restored.

### Elixirs<sup>[^46]</sup>

| **Elixir** | **Cost** | **qlvl** | **Effect** |
|------------|--------:|--------:|------------------|
| Elixir of Strength | 5,000 | 15 | Increases Strength by 1 |
| Elixir of Magic | 5,000 | 15 | Increases Magic by 1<sup>[^48]</sup> |
| Elixir of Dexterity | 5,000 | 15 | Increases Dexterity by 1 |
| Elixir of Vitality | 5,000<sup>[^47]</sup> | 20 | Increases Vitality by 1<sup>[^49]</sup> |

[^46]: In **multiplayer**, elixirs can be **bought from Adria** once your character reaches **level 26**. In **single-player**, they can be **bought from both Adria and Pepin** once you have been to **dlvl 13, the Hive, or the Crypt (Hellfire)**.  
[^47]: **Elixirs of Vitality** cannot be bought, only **found in dungeons**.  
[^48]: In **Hellfire**, the **Elixir of Magic** **also restores all of your mana**.  
[^49]: In **Hellfire**, the **Elixir of Vitality** **also restores all of your life**.  

Potions of Healing and Mana restore life and mana as stated below. Potions of Rejuvenation are basically treated as one Potion of Mana and one Potion of Healing. For information on how scrolls of healing and the Healing spell work, see chapter 4.1.2.

### **Potion Restoration Values**

| **Potion Type** | **Restores** |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Potion of Healing | bonus × maxlife / 8 to bonus × 3 × maxlife / 8 |
| Potion of Mana | bonus × maxmana / 8 to bonus × 3 × maxmana / 8 |

- Any value in the range is equally probable.
- The bonus is summarized in the table below.
- maxlife and maxmana are the modified values. If they are negative, the amount added will also be negative and in fact subtract life or mana.


### **Potion Bonus Multipliers**

| **Type**  | **Warrior** | **Rogue** | **Sorcerer** | **Monk** | **Bard** | **Barbarian** |
|-----------|:----------:|:---------:|:------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:------------:|
| Healing   | 2.0        | 1.5       | 1.0          | 1.5<sup>[^50]</sup> | 1.5<sup>[^50]</sup> | 2.0          |
| Mana      | 1.0        | 1.5       | 2.0          | 1.5<sup>[^50]</sup> | 1.5<sup>[^50]</sup> | 1.0          |

[^50]: When using a Potion of Rejuvenation the bonus for a Monk and a Bard is 1.0 due to a bug in Hellfire.


### 3.2.3 Books, scrolls and staves with spells

Books, scrolls and staves with spells are found in the dungeons but can also be bought from Adria. Healing scrolls and scrolls of Resurrection (only in multi player) can also be bought from Pepin. Below is listed how much you have to pay for scrolls, books, and data for calculating the cost of staves with spells. For information on how to calculate staff prices, see chapter 3.6. You can also find information about qlvl; see chapters 3.8 and 3.9 for information about qlvl and how to use it. Note that for books and staves, the qlvl is of the actual spell on that base item. The base item, *staff* or *book of*, has its own qlvl as well. As with other items, you can sell any book, scroll, or staff for one fourth of* the price. Note that in Hellfire, staves without spells are bought and sold at Griswold. In Hellfire, Wirt will also sell staves both with and without spells.

## **Spell Costs and Attributes**
