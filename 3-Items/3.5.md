## 3.5 Unique items

Unique items differ from normal magical items in that they have a special name and can have up to six different magical properties. You can still find more than one of each, even in the same game (in single player the game keeps track of what unique items exist in the current game, and will not create the same a second time). Having a different picture than that of the normal base item it is based upon is considered as one of the six special properties. All non quest unique items are based on a normal base item, and unless otherwise changed by the unique properties, retain all the stats of that normal base item. Unique quest items are based on special quest base items. Those special quest base items can be found in chapter 3.3. Such items are also noted by having n/a in the qlvl column.

If you are playing the Playstation version you should know that when you restart a new game, any unique item is transformed into gold, which is quite annoying.


### 3.5.1 Properties of unique items

In the tables below are listed all unique items in the game that you can equip, both the ones randomly generated and the ones given as part of quests. For special quest items that are unequipable, see chapter 3.3. The prices shown are the buying prices. You can never buy unique items however. The stated qlvl is used in item generation, see chapter 3.8. Please note that all items *below* a thick line are only available in Hellfire. The *Pic* column indicates whether the item has a unique picture or not.

[^117]: **The effect is +75%, *not* max resistance.** If you wear both a *Gotterdamerung* and a *Constricting Ring*, your resistance would still be 0%. Similarly, if you use an item that decreases any resistance, the final value may not be 75%.  
[^118]: **If you are using Mana Shield, the damage will be taken from your mana instead.** Due to rounding errors, the actual value may not be correctly reduced. See chapter 6.1.1 for more information.  
[^119]: **A quest item only available in *single-player*.**  
[^120]: **Has an effect equivalent to "of Puncturing".** In *Diablo*, adds +4-12 To Hit. In *Hellfire*, it reduces AC by 87.5% (or 12.5% if Barbarian, making any monster’s AC = 0), making it more effective than other suffixes with similar properties.  
[^121]: **A quest item, not truly a unique item.**

[^126]: **These items have the same picture.**  
[^127]: **A quest item only available in single player.**  
[^128]: **This item actually has the unique picture of the same item it is based on, so for all practical reasons it doesn’t really have a unique picture.**  



### 3.5.2 Unfindable unique items in multi player

Due to the way the game generates unique items (see chapter 3.8), some unique items will never be found in *multi player*. The same items are findable in single player but only if you find another unique item of the same base item and* qlvl first in the same game session. This phenomenon occurs when there are multiple items of the same base item and qlvl. The table below lists those items. Note that the list for Diablo is also applicable to Hellfire.

### Diablo vs. Hellfire Unique Items<sup>[^129]</sup>

| **Diablo**              | **Hellfire** |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Bramble (Ring)         | Armor of Gloom (Full Plate Mail) |
| Crackrust (Mace)       | Demonspike Coat (Full Plate Mail) |
| The Deflector (Buckler) | Giant’s Knuckle (Ring) |
| Gonnagal’s Dirk (Dagger) | The Grizzly (Two-Handed Sword) |
| Lightforge<sup>[^130]</sup> (Mace) | Inferno (Long Sword) |
| The Mangler (Large Axe) | Karik’s Ring (Ring) |
|                        | Mercurial Ring (Ring) |
|                        | Ring of Magma (Ring) |
|                        | Ring of the Mystics (Ring) |
|                        | Xorine’s Ring (Ring) |

[^129]: **In addition to the ones from Diablo.**  
[^130]: **It seems that although findable in single player, it will morph as soon as a new game is started or loaded.**  


The table below lists the order for those cases where more than two unique items have the same qlvl. All other cases only have two items with the same qlvl and it should be obvious that the unique item *not* in the table above is dropped first (and always dropped in multi player).

### Unique Item Order by Base Item<sup>[^131]</sup>

| **Base Item**      | **qlvl** | **Order, from First to Last** |
|-------------------|--------:|----------------------------------|
| Full Plate Mail  | 25     | Demon Plate Armor, Armor of Gloom, and Demonspike Coat |
| Mace            | 1      | Civerb’s Cudgel, Crackrust, and Lightforge |
| Ring            | 8      | Ring of Thunder, Ring of the Mystics, Ring of Magma, Karik’s Ring, Xorine’s Ring, Mercurial Ring, and Giant’s Knuckle |

[^131]: **In multiplayer, only the first unique item of each base type is findable.**
