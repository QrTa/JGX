## 3.7 Durability of items

All unique items and staves with spells found in the dungeon have full durability. So do all items bought in town, of course. All other items found in the dungeon only have partial durability in the range below:

Durability of items found in dungeon:	`(1 + maxdur/4) to 3×maxdur/4`


### 3.7.1 Losing durability

All items (except those that are indestructible) have a durability, which will, over time, decrease as you fight. The table below explains under what circumstances and with what chance the durability will go down. It will never go down by more than 1 at a time.

### **Durability Loss Conditions**

| **Item Type**  | **When Durability May Decrease** | **Chance of Decreasing** |
|---------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Armor<sup>[^132]</sup>  | Character is stunned      | 3/4 × 2/3 = 1/2<sup>[^133]</sup> (50.0%) |
| Helm<sup>[^132]</sup>   | Character is stunned      | 3/4 × 1/3 = 1/4<sup>[^133]</sup> (25.0%) |
| Shield       | Character blocks an attack      | 1/10 (10.0%)  |
| Melee Weapon | Character hits                 | 1/30 (3.3%)  |
| Bow         | Character fires                 | 1/40 (2.5%)  |

[^132]: If you don’t wear both armor and helm but only one of them, the chance is 3/4 that its durability will be decreased.  
[^133]: You will never lose durability on both the armor and the helm in the same hit.



### 3.7.2 Repair cost

Repairs are done at Griswold (or by a Warrior, see chapter 2.4). Griswold uses the following formulas to calculate the cost:

### **Repair Cost Formulas**

| **Formula** | **Applies To** | |
|------------|--------------|--|
| RpC = 0.15 × Price × (1 - CurDur/MaxDur) | For magical and unique items | |
| RpC = 0.50 × Price × (1 - CurDur/MaxDur) | For non-magical and unidentified items | |

### Variable Definitions for Repair Cost Calculations

| **Variable** | **Definition** |
|-------------|--------------|
| RpC | Repair Cost |
| Price | Buying price of the item |
| MaxDur | Maximum durability of the item |
| CurDur | Current durability of the item |


If the repair cost is less than 1 gold Griswold won’t repair it. That makes many of the cursed items irreparable. There also seems to be a bug so that when the ratio CurDur/MaxDur is greater than 99%, the repair cost is rounded down to 0 along the way and is thus not repairable until it takes more damage.

Just as with the price of magical items, when counting the value of CurDur/MaxDur you take into account only two digits after the decimal. Alternatively one can use the formulas below (plus the step by step list following) in which case the rounding is done automatically:

For magical and unique items first calculate:

`RpC = [ { [ (100×(MaxDur - CurDur)) / MaxDur] × (30 × Price) } / 100 ]`

For non magical and unidentified items first calculate:

`RpC = [ { [ (100×(MaxDur - CurDur)) / MaxDur] × Price } / 100 ]`

Then, do the following:

1. **If** `RpC = 1`, **then exit**.
2. **If** `RpC > 1`, **then** `RpC = [RpC / 2]` (divide the repair cost by 2), **then exit**.
3. **If** the item is a **non-magical and non-unique** item, **set** `RpC = 1`, **then exit**.
4. **If** the item is **not identified**, **set** `RpC = 1`, **then exit**.
5. At this point, the item is an **identified magical or unique item** and `RpC` is `0` or below `0`;  
   - The item is **not repairable** (this applies to identified **cursed** and some **semi-cursed** items).
