## 4.1 Spells available to players

All spells in Diablo and Hellfire are equally learnable for all character classes. To learn them to a high slvl one needs a high magic attribute, and not all character classes have the ability to reach the needed 255 magic attribute that is needed for the highest spell levels.


### 4.1.1 List of spells and spell effects

Below is a summary of all spells you will find in Diablo and Hellfire. They are arranged in the same way they appear in your spell book. Page 5, Jester, Magi and Mana only exist in Hellfire.

### 4.1.2 Details about spells

Now follows some details about each spell. Not all types of data are applicable for each spell. Below is an explanation of what is told about most spells. If no information type is given for a specific spell, it is either due to it not applying (for example the speed of a stationary effect), or due to it not being known to me. For more details about how spells attack, see chapter 5.6.5 and more specifically chapter 6.1.8.

In previous versions there existed information for spells if they had any distance factor included in their To Hit calculation. From what I have found, no spell has a distance factor; or rather, it is always 0. Only arrows (including fire and lightning arrows and arrows from traps and monsters) have a distance factor. As a consequence, I have removed any reference to a distance in the detailed list of spells.

| **Property**   | **Description** |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Type**      | Magic, fire, or lightning. Some spells do not belong to these types and are listed as *n/a*. |
| **Damage**    | The stated damage in the spell book (see below for more details). Can be split into minimum and maximum damage where appropriate. |
| **Quick Damage** | A simplified way to calculate damage, but not as accurate. Can be split into minimum and maximum damage where appropriate. |
| **Real Damage** | The actual damage used by the game, which may differ from the stated damage. Non-missile spells may attack multiple times. If the real damage is identical to the stated damage or has a linear distribution, it is omitted for brevity. |
| **Duration**  | The time each spell lasts, given in seconds unless otherwise stated. Moving spells are generally terminated if they hit a dungeon feature, such as a wall. |
| **Speed**     | The speed at which the spell effect travels. This is a relative value for comparing different spells and normal arrows. Higher values indicate faster movement. Not to be confused with player or monster walk speed. For arrow speed, see [Chapter 2.2.3](#223-weapon-speed). |
| **Blockable** | Indicates whether a spell can be blocked. <br> - In *Diablo*, a spell can only be blocked if the target has **0% resistance**. <br> - In *Hellfire*, any blockable spell can be blocked **regardless of resistance**. |



**Damage**

Some spells use a recursive formula to calculate damage. The notation for these spells was introduced by Sourceror and I have used it here too. Here follows an explanation on how it works. To make it easier to write damage formulas for spells using multiple random numbers, I have also added a notation for that.

| **Notation**       | **Definition**                                | **Notes**                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `[ ]`              | Round down                                    |                               |
| `Rnd[x]`           | A random number in the range **0** to **x-1** |                               |
| `Rec(slvl, slvl0)` | Recursive function, defined as follows:       |                               |
|                    | `Rec(0, slvl0)`:                              | `[slvl0]`                     |
|                    | For `slvl > 0`; `Rec(slvl,slvl0)`:            | `[Rec(slvl-1, slvl0) × 9/8]`  |
| `Itt(nbr, value)`  | Iterative function, defined as follows:       |                               |
|                    |`Itt(0, value)`:                               | `value`                       |
|                    | For `nbr > 0`; `Itt(nbr, value)`:             | `Itt(nbr-1, value) + value`   |


The easiest way to understand how the recursive function works is to make an example. A Fireball’s maximum damage for a level 30 character is:

| Step | Calculation | Result |
|------:|---------------------------|--------|
| 1. | `Rec(slvl, 40 + 2×clvl); clvl = 30` | |
| 2. | First, calculate damage for spell level 0: | `40 + 2×30 = 100` |
| 3. | Damage for spell level 1: | `[100 × 9/8] = 112` |
| 4. | Damage for spell level 2: | `[112 × 9/8] = 126` |
| 5. | … and so on | |


Note that it is very important to round down. For those spells using this recursive formula I have also given a quick formula. For a Fireball’s maximum damage it is:

(40 + 2×clvl) × (9/8)^slvl

Note that this formula does not round down and you will therefore get a damage a bit too high, but it will still be more or less accurate. For a level 20 fireball from a level 50 character the correct maximum damage is 1442, while this quick method gives 1476. In the table below, I have listed values for use with the quick formula.


|**Summary for quick damage**||||||||
|----------|------|----------|------|----------|------|----------|------|
| (9/8)^1 = 1.125 | (9/8)^6 = 2.027 | (9/8)^11 = 3.653 | (9/8)^16 = 6.583 |
| (9/8)^2 = 1.266 | (9/8)^7 = 2.281 | (9/8)^12 = 4.110 | (9/8)^17 = 7.406 |
| (9/8)^3 = 1.424 | (9/8)^8 = 2.566 | (9/8)^13 = 4.624 | (9/8)^18 = 8.332 |
| (9/8)^4 = 1.602 | (9/8)^9 = 2.887 | (9/8)^14 = 5.202 | (9/8)^19 = 9.373 |
| (9/8)^5 = 1.802 | (9/8)^10 = 3.247 | (9/8)^15 = 5.852 | (9/8)^20 = 10.545 |


Lets make an example for the iterative function as well. Take the damage of the flash spell (case 1). It uses a recursive formulas where the slvl0 (see above) is actually first calculated using an iterative formula. Lets calculate slvl0 for a level 30 character:

slvl0 = Itt(clvl, Rnd[20] + 1); clvl=30

This means we should, 30 times, calculate Rnd[20] + 1 and add all those 30 values together. For each value, a new random number should be created, for if the same random number would be used, it would have been written as clvl×(Rnd[20] + 1) instead. This sum of 30 values, ranging from 1 to 20 in the example, is the slvl0 which is then used in the recursive formula. It is worth noticing that if there is any random number used in the iterative formula, the result would typically be a distribution of the values as in a bell curve.


**Splash damage**

Some spells do additional splash damage. Splash damage is always considered a separate attack and thus does its own to hit check and can hit or miss independently from the initial attack. Of course, there need to be some hit before the splash damage is applied. Such a hit can be either a normal target or such a thing as a wall. As an example a fireball will cause splash damage to all adjacent locations when it hits a wall.

| **Duration** | 0.95 seconds |
| **Blockable** | No |
| **Notes**    | - The Flash spell is actually composed of two different effects, the two different Real Damages given are for the two different effects. The first hits in front of you and to the sides, the other behind you. <br> - You seem to be able to do two flashes in a row, then you have to wait for them to finish. Don’t know how this affects damage though. <br> - While casting Flash, you are temporarily invulnerable and can’t access the normal GUI. <br> - The flash will try to hit once every 0.05 seconds for a total of 19 times. |

| **Golem**  |  |

| **Notes**    | - The lightning is actually a stationary effect, but the initiation will be delayed the further away it appears, giving an appearance of moving. <br> - This delay "travels" with a speed of 32. <br> - The bolt will try to hit once every 0.05 seconds for a total of [slvl/2] + 6 times. |

| **Mana Shield**  |  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type**      | n/a |
| **Damage Reduction in Diablo** | 33% |
| **Damage Reduction in Hellfire** | See below |
| **Duration**  | Until mana reaches 0 or you leave the current dlvl |
| **Note for Hellfire only:** | |
| - A Mana Shield decreases the damage taken, but due to a bug, the reduction actually decreases as slvl goes up. |
| - The damage is reduced by the following amount: 100 / (3 × slvl)% |
| - If slvl is higher than 7, set slvl to 7. |
| **Note for both Diablo and Hellfire:** | |
| - For slvl 0, there is never any reduction of the damage. |
| - Due to a bug, you will neither be stunned nor pushed back by *the bear* or Diablo if you receive damage (before modification by the Mana Shield) greater than your current life. |

| **Phasing**  |  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type**    | n/a |
| **Note:**   | |
| - Due to being a non-targeting spell, it is slightly faster than Teleport, and it may thus be easier to escape with this spell than with Teleport. |

### 4.1.5 Mana cost and magic requirements for spells

Casting spells costs mana and each spell has an initial mana cost at slvl 1. For each slvl the mana cost then decreases by a certain amount specific for each spell until it reaches its minimum mana cost. The table below shows the mana cost for each spell as well as the slvl you reach the minimum mana cost (unless stated otherwise, use the 100% value in the table unless stated otherwise for a character class). Note that Rogues, Monks and Bards only pay 75% of the mana cost (use the 75% value in the table). In Hellfire (after patch 1.01) the Sorcerer only pays 50% of the mana cost (use the 50% value in the table for Hellfire and the 100% value for Diablo). However, no character class ever pays less than the minimum mana cost. Casting spells from scrolls and staves do not cost any mana, but you have to have the required magic to do so.

For staves, the required magic to cast a spell from it is the same as it is to learn the same spell to the first slvl. For scrolls, the mana required to cast a spell is normally a bit less. The table below also shows those required magic levels. For information about prices and slvl of books, scrolls, and staves with spells, see chapter 3.2.3.

The table above has the magic requirement to learn a spell to level 1. For each additional spell level the magic requirement is 20% higher to learn. To make it easier for you, the table below lists the magic requirement for each spell and spell level. Note that if the magic requirement is 213 or higher, it is always adjusted to 255.

### 4.1.6 Spell level of cast spells

When you cast a spell, it will always be cast at the slvl you know the spell plus any additional levels you get from items. As your slvl can go down (by hitting an Enchanted shrine, for example), it is possible to get a known spell to slvl 0. When this happens, you can no longer use the spell, unless some items you are wearing raise the slvl above 0. The slvl can never be negative. Maximum base slvl is 15. With the correct items equipped, the modified slvl can be brought to a maximum of 20.

When casting a spell from a scroll or staff, it will have the same slvl as the slvl you know the spell (including any modifications from items). If you don’t know the spell it will be cast at slvl 1 (plus any modifications from items). There is a bug, however. If you cast a spell from a scroll and currently have another spell hot keyed, it will use the slvl of the hot keyed spell instead of the spell you are casting. This is true even if you don’t know the spell.


### 4.1.7 Targeting of spells

The casting of spells in Diablo and Hellfire is normally easy to do. Just click on the mouse. Some spells need to be targeted, some change the cursor, and others just cast no matter where you are targeting it. The table below is a summary of how different spells behave.

It is worth noticing that there can be a small delay between the time you click on the mouse and the actual cast of the spell. If you change the cursor position during the time in between, or change the spell, you will normally cast the new spell and the target will be the new position of the cursor. Another side effect of this is that the actual mana reduction is done when the spell is cast which may at times lead to mana reaching negative values (the check for enough mana to cast the spell is done when you click the mouse, while the actual reduction is done when it is cast; due to this effect , one can, if one clicks fast enough, end up with negative mana, or be able to cast a spell twice from a scroll, or squeeze out an extra spell from a staff).


**Area**

The spell does not target in any way and normally affects a larger area. It does not matter where on the screen you position the cursor when you cast this spell. Nova is such a spell.


**Cursor**

The spell will, when cast, change the cursor. You will then have to click on the desired target to be affected by the spell. It does not matter where on the screen you position the cursor when you cast the spell initially. A good example of a spell that affects the cursor is Telekinesis.


**Direction**

The spell is only controllable in that you can affect in what direction from your character the spell will go. Flame Wave is such a spell.


**Target**

The effect of the spell will target the location (or monster) on the screen where the cursor is positioned at the time you cast the spell. Lightning is such a spell.


**Auto**

This spell targets a monster but you do not have to actually point the cursor on the monster, since it will automatically target a specific monster (normally the one closest to the cursor). Some spells are both targeted and automatically seek up a target. This is true for spells like Elemental and Bone Spirit, they are cast at the position you cursor is at but will then automatically seek out a target as well.


**Self**

The spell affects your character directly. Infravision is such a spell.

[^1]: **Chain Lightning** will produce one lightning bolt that is targeted just as normal lightning. The other bolts are automatically targeted.  
[^2]: If there is no monster targeted, **Stone Curse** and **Berserk** will affect the monster closest to the cursor.  
[^3]: **Jester** casts another random spell. See each individual spell for behavior.  
[^4]: The direction of **Lightning Wall** and **Fire Wall** is always perpendicular to the caster.
