## 4.1 Spells available to players

All spells in Diablo and Hellfire are equally learnable for all character classes. To learn them to a high slvl one needs a high magic attribute, and not all character classes have the ability to reach the needed 255 magic attribute that is needed for the highest spell levels.


### 4.1.1 List of spells and spell effects

Below is a summary of all spells you will find in Diablo and Hellfire. They are arranged in the same way they appear in your spell book. Page 5, Jester, Magi and Mana only exist in Hellfire.

### 4.1.2 Details about spells

Now follows some details about each spell. Not all types of data are applicable for each spell. Below is an explanation of what is told about most spells. If no information type is given for a specific spell, it is either due to it not applying (for example the speed of a stationary effect), or due to it not being known to me. For more details about how spells attack, see chapter 5.6.5 and more specifically chapter 6.1.8.

In previous versions there existed information for spells if they had any distance factor included in their To Hit calculation. From what I have found, no spell has a distance factor; or rather, it is always 0. Only arrows (including fire and lightning arrows and arrows from traps and monsters) have a distance factor. As a consequence, I have removed any reference to a distance in the detailed list of spells.

Type:	Magic, fire or lightning. Some spells are not of one of the three main types and

are listed as n/a.

Damage:	Stated damage in spell book (see below for more details), can be split up into

min. and max. damage where appropriate.

Quick Damage:	A quicker way to calculate damage but not as accurate. Can be split up into min.

and max. damage where appropriate.

Real Damage:	The real damage as used by the game. This is not necessarily the same as the

stated damage, especially for non missile spells, as they instead can often attack several times. If no real damage is stated, it is identical to the damage stated. Also, if the real damage distribution is linear within the range given, it is not shown either. All this is done to reduce the amount of data presented, as it is already extensive.

Duration:	This is how long each spell lasts. The time given is always in seconds unless

otherwise stated. Moving spells will generally be terminated if they hit any dungeon feature, such as a wall.

Speed:	This is the speed at which the spell effect travels. It is a relative number used for

comparison between different spells and normal arrows, and is not to be confused with walk speed for players and monsters. The higher the value, the faster it is. For information about the speed of arrows, see chapter 2.2.3.

Blockable:	This will tell if a spell is blockable or not. In Diablo, you will only block if you

have 0% resistance. In Hellfire, you will block anything blockable regardless of your resistance.


**Damage**

Some spells use a recursive formula to calculate damage. The notation for these spells was introduced by Sourceror and I have used it here too. Here follows an explanation on how it works. To make it easier to write damage formulas for spells using multiple random numbers, I have also added a notation for that.

|[ ]|round down||
| :- | :- | :- |
|Rnd[x]|is a random number in the range 0 to x-1||
|Rec(slvl, slvl0)|recursive function, defined as follows:||
||Rec(0, slvl0):|[slvl0]|
||and for slvl>0; Rec(slvl, slvl0):|[Rec(slvl-1, slvl0) × 9/8]|
|Itt(nbr, value)|iterative function, defined as follows:||
||Itt(0, value):|value|
||and for nbr>0; Itt(nbr, value):|Itt(nbr-1, value) + value|

The easiest way to understand how the recursive function works is to make an example. A Fireball’s maximum damage for a level 30 character is:

1. Rec(slvl, 40 + 2×clvl); clvl=30

|2\.|First calculate damage for spell level 0:|40 + 2×clvl = 100|
| -: | :- | :- |
|3\.|Damage for spell level 1 can then be calculated as:|[100 × 9/8] = 112|
|4\.|Damage for spell level 2 can then be calculated as:|[112 × 9/8] = 126|

5. and so on…

Note that it is very important to round down. For those spells using this recursive formula I have also given a quick formula. For a Fireball’s maximum damage it is:

(40 + 2×clvl) × (9/8)^slvl

Note that this formula does not round down and you will therefore get a damage a bit too high, but it will still be more or less accurate. For a level 20 fireball from a level 50 character the correct maximum damage is 1442, while this quick method gives 1476. In the table below, I have listed values for use with the quick formula.

**Summary for quick damage**

|(9/8)^1|1\.125|(9/8)^6|2\.027|(9/8)^11|3\.653|(9/8)^16|6\.583|
| -: | -: | :- | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: |
|(9/8)^2|1\.266|(9/8)^7|2\.281|(9/8)^12|4\.110|(9/8)^17|7\.406|
|(9/8)^3|1\.424|(9/8)^8|2\.566|(9/8)^13|4\.624|(9/8)^18|8\.332|
|(9/8)^4|1\.602|(9/8)^9|2\.887|(9/8)^14|5\.202|(9/8)^19|9\.373|
|(9/8)^5|1\.802|(9/8)^10|3\.247|(9/8)^15|5\.852|(9/8)^20|10\.545|

Lets make an example for the iterative function as well. Take the damage of the flash spell (case 1). It uses a recursive formulas where the slvl0 (see above) is actually first calculated using an iterative formula. Lets calculate slvl0 for a level 30 character:

slvl0 = Itt(clvl, Rnd[20] + 1); clvl=30

This means we should, 30 times, calculate Rnd[20] + 1 and add all those 30 values together. For each value, a new random number should be created, for if the same random number would be used, it would have been written as clvl×(Rnd[20] + 1) instead. This sum of 30 values, ranging from 1 to 20 in the example, is the slvl0 which is then used in the recursive formula. It is worth noticing that if there is any random number used in the iterative formula, the result would typically be a distribution of the values as in a bell curve.


**Splash damage**

Some spells do additional splash damage. Splash damage is always considered a separate attack and thus does its own to hit check and can hit or miss independently from the initial attack. Of course, there need to be some hit before the splash damage is applied. Such a hit can be either a normal target or such a thing as a wall. As an example a fireball will cause splash damage to all adjacent locations when it hits a wall.

### 4.1.5 Mana cost and magic requirements for spells

Casting spells costs mana and each spell has an initial mana cost at slvl 1. For each slvl the mana cost then decreases by a certain amount specific for each spell until it reaches its minimum mana cost. The table below shows the mana cost for each spell as well as the slvl you reach the minimum mana cost (unless stated otherwise, use the 100% value in the table unless stated otherwise for a character class). Note that Rogues, Monks and Bards only pay 75% of the mana cost (use the 75% value in the table). In Hellfire (after patch 1.01) the Sorcerer only pays 50% of the mana cost (use the 50% value in the table for Hellfire and the 100% value for Diablo). However, no character class ever pays less than the minimum mana cost. Casting spells from scrolls and staves do not cost any mana, but you have to have the required magic to do so.

For staves, the required magic to cast a spell from it is the same as it is to learn the same spell to the first slvl. For scrolls, the mana required to cast a spell is normally a bit less. The table below also shows those required magic levels. For information about prices and slvl of books, scrolls, and staves with spells, see chapter 3.2.3.

### 4.1.6 Spell level of cast spells

When you cast a spell, it will always be cast at the slvl you know the spell plus any additional levels you get from items. As your slvl can go down (by hitting an Enchanted shrine, for example), it is possible to get a known spell to slvl 0. When this happens, you can no longer use the spell, unless some items you are wearing raise the slvl above 0. The slvl can never be negative. Maximum base slvl is 15. With the correct items equipped, the modified slvl can be brought to a maximum of 20.

When casting a spell from a scroll or staff, it will have the same slvl as the slvl you know the spell (including any modifications from items). If you don’t know the spell it will be cast at slvl 1 (plus any modifications from items). There is a bug, however. If you cast a spell from a scroll and currently have another spell hot keyed, it will use the slvl of the hot keyed spell instead of the spell you are casting. This is true even if you don’t know the spell.


### 4.1.7 Targeting of spells

The casting of spells in Diablo and Hellfire is normally easy to do. Just click on the mouse. Some spells need to be targeted, some change the cursor, and others just cast no matter where you are targeting it. The table below is a summary of how different spells behave.

It is worth noticing that there can be a small delay between the time you click on the mouse and the actual cast of the spell. If you change the cursor position during the time in between, or change the spell, you will normally cast the new spell and the target will be the new position of the cursor. Another side effect of this is that the actual mana reduction is done when the spell is cast which may at times lead to mana reaching negative values (the check for enough mana to cast the spell is done when you click the mouse, while the actual reduction is done when it is cast; due to this effect , one can, if one clicks fast enough, end up with negative mana, or be able to cast a spell twice from a scroll, or squeeze out an extra spell from a staff).


**Area**

The spell does not target in any way and normally affects a larger area. It does not matter where on the screen you position the cursor when you cast this spell. Nova is such a spell.


**Cursor**

The spell will, when cast, change the cursor. You will then have to click on the desired target to be affected by the spell. It does not matter where on the screen you position the cursor when you cast the spell initially. A good example of a spell that affects the cursor is Telekinesis.


**Direction**

The spell is only controllable in that you can affect in what direction from your character the spell will go. Flame Wave is such a spell.


**Target**

The effect of the spell will target the location (or monster) on the screen where the cursor is positioned at the time you cast the spell. Lightning is such a spell.


**Auto**

This spell targets a monster but you do not have to actually point the cursor on the monster, since it will automatically target a specific monster (normally the one closest to the cursor). Some spells are both targeted and automatically seek up a target. This is true for spells like Elemental and Bone Spirit, they are cast at the position you cursor is at but will then automatically seek out a target as well.


**Self**

The spell affects your character directly. Infravision is such a spell.

1. Chain Lightning will produce one lightning bolt that is targeted just as normal lightning. The other bolts are automatically targeted.

1. If there is no monster targeted, Stone Curse and Berserk will affect the monster closest to the cursor.

1. This spell casts another random spell. See each individual spell for the behavior.

1. The direction of the wall is always perpendicular to the caster.
