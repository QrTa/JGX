## 4.2 Spell casting monsters

Some monsters have the ability to do magical attacks. Monsters in Diablo can only use spells that are available to the player (although they work a bit differently in regard to damage, for example), except for Spitting Terrors. In Hellfire, there are many new monsters that also have the ability to do magical attacks. Often those are new ones that are not available to the player in any way. The tables below summarize all monsters with magical attacks as well as what type of magic it is (not always obvious).

### 4.2.1 Details about monster spells in Diablo

Below are listed all those spells that monsters are able to use. In most cases they are identical to the ones used by players. although some differences can exist. If the damage is stated as *min - max*, the damage is identical to the one listed for melee damage in chapter 5.
