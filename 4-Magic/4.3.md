## 4.3 Traps

Most traps are of magical nature, and thus it is appropriate to explain how they work here. Traps can be set off when you open chests, sarcophagi, barrels, or doors. There are 7 different types of traps (including skeletons) in the original Diablo. Three new ones were added in Hellfire. The probability of a trap is shown in the table below. Traps originating from shrines are not covered by this guide.

1. Sarcophagi only exist in the Crypt, never in Hell.
1. In each cluster of barrels, pods and urns, the first barrel placed has a 25% chance having an explosion trap. All subsequent barrels have a 20% chance. As the number of barrels in a cluster is very hard to calculate accurately, I have used the value of 20% for all barrels. This will also affect the value for skeletons slightly, as it is 20% for a *non* exploding barrel.

1. Skeleton traps are, of course, only available if there are skeletons on the same level.

1. Hell and Crypt can’t have traps form doors.

1. The probabilities for doors apply to doors that *do* have traps. It seems that the probability to have traps is linked to the actual dungeon layout for doors in that it needs a wall opposite to it.

1. Rooms also includes the fenced locations in caves. A room does not necessarily need to have a door, in cats and especially in hell, many rooms just have an opening.

For damage and other information about the traps, see below. For damage, when two values or formulas are given, the top one is minimum damage and the bottom one is maximum damage. With fire arrows, the maximum damage might at times be less than the minimum damage (possible on dlvl 1-8). In that case, the actual damage done is always identical to the minimum damage. The table also list some dungeon features that while not being traps, still deal damage to players.

1. In caves, hell, the Hive, and the Crypt it will originate form the chest, pod or urn.
1. The bolt will try to hit once every 0.05 seconds.


**To Hit**

To Hit for traps is calculated according to the formulas below.

|To Hit for an arrow trap:|100 - AC/2|
| :- | :- |
|To Hit for a magic trap:|40|

As with attacks from monsters, there is also an automatic chance of hitting for traps, and it is listed below. Of course, the auto To Hit for magic traps is 40%, even on dungeon levels 14 to 16.

|arrow trap:|10%|
| :- | -: |
|magic trap:|40%|
|on dungeon level 14:|20%|
|on dungeon level 15:|25%|
|on dungeon level 16:|30%|

- magic traps includes Fire Wall, Flame Wave and Ring of Fire attacks from other players.
