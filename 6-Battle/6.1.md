## **6.1 General Information**

Before diving into the details of combat, it's essential to understand some fundamental mechanics of how players and monsters function. Both entities exist in one of several states, including:

- **Standing**
- **Walking**
- **Attacking**
- **Casting Spells**
- **Taking Hit Recovery**
- **Being Stoned**
- **Dying**

A character or monster must **complete** its current action before starting a new one. However, **getting hit** can interrupt an action, potentially forcing the target into **hit recovery** or, if the damage is severe enough, into **dying mode**. Players (but not monsters) may also enter a **blocking state** when carrying a shield. For action timing details, refer to:
- **Chapter 2.3** (for players)
- **Chapter 5.3.4** (for monsters)

### **Combat Steps**
Most combat interactions follow a structured sequence of steps:

1. **Pre-Hit Check**  
   Determines if the target is valid.  
   - Players are immune to their own attacks.  
   - Monsters are immune to other monsters' attacks (except in *Hellfire* where berserk monsters can attack each other).  
   - Melee weapons lose durability only if they actually hit something, while bows may lose durability even without a target.  

2. **To-Hit Calculation**  
   - The game determines whether the attack lands.  
   - If the attack misses, further steps are skipped.  

3. **Blocking (Players Only)**  
   - If the attack is successful, the game checks if the player successfully blocks the attack.  
   - If the block is successful, the **damage step is skipped**.  

4. **Damage Calculation**  
   - The game calculates the damage, considering **resistances**, **armor**, **enhancements**, and **other modifiers**.  
   - The calculated damage is then applied to the target.  

5. **Hit Consequences**  
   - Checks for effects triggered by a hit, such as:  
     - Hit recovery  
     - Life/mana steal  
     - Knockback  
     - Death  

Not all steps occur in every combat interaction. Additionally, some actions are unique to *Diablo* or *Hellfire*â€”these cases are explicitly noted.

## **6.1.1 Mana Shield**

**Mana Shield** is a spell that redirects incoming damage from life to mana while also **reducing** the total damage taken. This section clarifies how it interacts with combat.

For **spell details**, such as **mana cost** and **book requirements**, see **Chapter 4**.

### **Mana Shield Processing**
Mana Shield is categorized as a **magical effect** and is processed after all attacks have been calculated. It **does not** prevent hits or reduce damage **at the moment of impact**. Instead, damage is first applied normally, potentially triggering **hit recovery** or **dying mode**, before Mana Shield later reverses the effect.

This delay can cause unintended behavior, as described below.

---

### **Mana Shield Step-by-Step Breakdown**
1. **Check if the playerâ€™s life has changed since the last update.**  
   - If unchanged, exit.  
2. **If life has increased (e.g., from healing), update the new value and exit.**  
3. **Calculate the decrease in life since the last update.**  
   - This represents the total **damage taken**.  
4. **If skill level (slvl) = 0, skip steps 5 and 6.**  
5. **Apply damage reduction formula:**  
   - *Diablo:* `Damage - (Damage / 3)`  
   - *Hellfire:* `Damage - (Damage / (3 Ã— slvl))`  
     - *(If slvl > 7, treat slvl as 7)*  
6. **Restore life to its previous value.**  
7. **Subtract the reduced damage amount from mana instead.**  
8. **If mana is still above 0:**  
   - If the player was in **dying mode**, reset them to **standing mode**.  
   - Exit.  
9. **If mana has reached or fallen below 0:**  
   - Set mana to 0.  
   - Reduce life by the amount **exceeding** the available mana.  
10. **Terminate Mana Shield.**  
11. **If life remains above 0:**  
   - If the player was in **dying mode**, reset them to **standing mode**.  
   - Exit.  
12. **If life reaches 0, set the player to dying mode.**  

---

### **Bugs & Exploits**
Because Mana Shield is applied **after** normal combat calculations, it can cause unexpected effects:

1. **Dying Mode Reversal**  
   - If the initial attack kills the player, Mana Shield may **resurrect them instantly** by restoring their life via mana absorption.  
   - This can **negate** certain mechanics, such as **knockback** and **additional attacks** that should have landed before revival.  

2. **Multi-Attack Avoidance**  
   - If multiple monsters attack at **exactly** the same time, the first attack may "kill" the player.  
   - Mana Shield then **revives them**, preventing subsequent hits from registering.  

3. **Hellfire-Specific Bugs** *(Fixed in *Diablo* v1.07)*  
   - **Excessive Damage upon Shield Termination**  
     - When Mana Shield depletes, the next hit may deal **up to twice** the intended damage.  
   - **Stacked Mana Shields**  
     - Casting multiple Mana Shields **does not** increase protection.  
     - However, when the last shield expires, the player may take **excessive damage from each previous cast**.  

These issues arise from the **delayed** nature of Mana Shield activation. The spell does **not** prevent damageâ€”it simply **reverses** it **after** normal combat mechanics have already taken place.

---

### **6.1.2 Fire Wall, Flame Wave, and Ring of Fire**

**Fire Wall** and **Flame Wave** are unique spells in that they are the **only** spells capable of damaging their own caster. Additionally, when targeting players (including the caster), these spells behave like **magic traps**, meaning they always have a **fixed 40% To Hit chance** rather than using the standard hit calculations.

However, when these spells target **monsters**, they follow the **normal To Hit mechanics** as described in the respective combat calculations.

---

### **6.1.3 Reflect**

The **Reflect** spell is correctly handled within the standard **damage routines**, unlike **Mana Shield**, which is processed separately after damage is applied.  

- **Reflect applies a flag to the character** upon activation.  
- If this flag is set, **incoming damage is properly reduced** and **reflected back to the attacker**.  
- This **prevents** the **bugs** associated with **Mana Shield**, which arises from its delayed application in the game loop.  

If **Mana Shield** had been implemented similarly, it would have avoided many of the **problems and exploits** described in the previous section.

---

### **6.1.4 Life and Mana Stealing**

Items with **Life Steal** and **Mana Steal** effects operate **independently** from each other. However, **higher percentages override lower ones**, meaning they are **not cumulative**.

For example:
- A **5% stealing item** will **completely override** a **3% stealing item** of the same type.  
- However, **one item with 3% mana steal** and **another with 5% life steal** will **both** apply.  

Similarly, **two items with 3% stealing** or **two with 5% stealing** do not stack. The **only** exception is the **random life steal effect** found on **The Undead Crown**, which **does** stack with other life-stealing effects.

ðŸ’¡ **Life and Mana Stealing Notes:**
- **Only works against monsters**, never against **players**.  
  - The **Undead Crownâ€™s** random life steal **can** affect players, but since it is **single-player only**, this **never matters** in practice.  
- **If equipping three life/mana stealing items**, resolve them **step by step**, first checking **two** items, then checking the **end result** against the third.  

---

### **Life & Mana Stealing Interaction Table**

| **Stealing Type**       | **3% Mana** | **5% Mana** | **3% Life** | **5% Life** | **Random Life<sup>[^1]</sup>** |
|-------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **3% Mana**            | 3% Mana    | 5% Mana    | 3% Mana, 3% Life  | 3% Mana, 5% Life  | 3% Mana, 0-12.5% Life  |
| **5% Mana**            | 5% Mana    | 5% Mana    | 5% Mana, 3% Life  | 5% Mana, 5% Life  | 5% Mana, 0-12.5% Life  |
| **3% Life**            | 3% Mana    | 5% Mana    | 3% Life  | 5% Life  | 3-15.5% Life  |

[^1]: Steals a **random** amount of **life** between **0% and 12.5%** each time you hit.

### 6.1.5 Fire and Lightning Damage on Melee Weapons

When an attack includes additional fire or lightning damage, the game handles it separately from physical damage. Upon striking (even if the main attack misses), an additional magical effect of the appropriate type is spawned, which is then processed during the magical effect update phase. 

#### Key Mechanics:
- The magical effect will use **normal magical To Hit** and apply **resistance** checks as usual.
- It **deals the current fire or lightning damage** of the attacker.
- The effect **only hits once**, but it will attempt to hit up to:
  - **7 times for lightning**
  - **9 times for fire**
- If an enemy moves away before the effect completes, they may avoid some of the damage.

---

### 6.1.6 Fire and Lightning Damage on Bows

Fire and lightning damage on **bows** follows a similar process but with a few key differences:

#### How It Works:
- Unlike melee weapons, **fire and lightning arrows do not spawn separate effects**â€”the attack itself transitions into a fire or lightning hit upon impact.
- This **secondary magical hit can strike multiple times**, unlike melee fire or lightning effects.
- The effect **attempts to hit up to 7 times for lightning, 9 times for fire** before disappearing.
- **All fire and lightning bonuses from other gear (rings, amulets, etc.) apply to the attack** despite being a ranged attack.

#### Known Bugs:
- **To Hit Bug**: Fire and lightning arrows use the **normal arrow To Hit formulas** instead of magical To Hit.
- **PvP Damage Bug**: Fire and lightning damage from bows **is not halved** in PvP combat, unlike other magic damage.
- **Multi-Hit Bug**: Fire and lightning arrows can **damage a target multiple times**, which may be unintended.
- **Improper Damage Calculation**: 
  - The game **treats the bow's total physical damage as the base for fire and lightning damage**, applying **+% Damage modifiers** to it incorrectly.
- **Inaccurate Impact Location**:
  - Fire and lightning effects **do not always hit the same location as the original arrow**, leading to inconsistencies in damage application.

> **Note:** The known bugs above apply throughout the combat system. They will not be repeated in later sections.

---

### 6.1.7 Charge Attacks

Charge attacks are a special type of movement-based attack used by some monsters. Instead of attacking immediately, the monster **moves during the magical effect update phase** and **only attacks upon reaching its target**.

#### Special Charge Mechanics:
- **Glooms do not attack with Charge**: They use it purely for movement.
- **Base To Hit for charge attacks is 500%**, modified normally per [Chapter 6.2.3](#).
- **Blocking applies normally**: If the attack is blocked, it deals no damage.
- **Damage is calculated normally**: No special multipliers apply beyond what is typical for melee damage.

#### Special Monster Interactions:
- **Vipers do not trigger hit recovery** on their targets when using Charge.
- **Horned Demons and similar monsters (including certain unique monsters and their party members) cause hit recovery and knockback on a successful Charge hit.**

#### Known Charge-Related Bug:
- **Monsters using Charge can sometimes cross lava in the Caves**, bypassing terrain restrictions that would normally block their movement. This may be an intended feature or a bug.

---

### 6.1.8 How Spells Really Work

Before diving into the details of actual attacks, it's useful to understand how the game handles spells. This section provides a brief explanation to make the **Non-Melee Attacks** chapter easier to follow while clarifying the mechanics behind spell interactions. 

At their core, **non-melee attacks are magical in nature**. The only exception is **arrows**, but they function similarly to projectiles like Fireball, so conceptually, they behave the same way. Every spell or missile in the game is classified as an **effect**, and during the **effect update phase**, each effect undergoes its processing cycle, determining its behavior.

---

### **Missile-Based Spells**
Missile spells, such as **Fireball, Charged Bolt, and Holy Bolt**, are **effects that travel through the dungeon** at a fixed speed, typically in a straight line. 

#### **Key Mechanics:**
- Upon **entering a new location**, the spell checks for a **potential target**.
- If a valid target is detected, **an attack attempt is made**.
- The spell also checks for **collision with walls or obstacles**â€”if detected, it **terminates**.
- Certain spells, like **Elemental and Flame Wave**, do **not terminate upon impact**. Instead, they **continue moving**, potentially hitting multiple enemies.
- Multi-missile spells, like **Nova and Charged Bolt**, consist of **multiple independent projectiles**.
- **Persistent spells**, such as **Fire Wall**, can **hit a target multiple times** over their duration.

---

### **The Special Case of Lightning**
Some spells consist of **multiple effects** working together. **Lightning** is a prime example:

1. The **initial, invisible effect** originates at the **caster's location** and moves outward at a fixed speed.
2. As it travels, it **spawns stationary lightning bolts** at each step.
3. Each **bolt remains in place for a fixed duration**, attempting to hit anything in its tile.
4. Bolts **disappear sequentially**, creating the **illusion of a moving lightning stream**.
5. The **speed of the lightning effect** is determined by the **speed of the invisible initial effect**, not the bolts themselves.

> ðŸ”¹ **Other spells function similarly**, using hidden mechanics to achieve their visual effects.

---

### **Spell Termination Conditions**
A spell can end due to **several conditions**:
| **Termination Cause** | **Description** |
|----------------------|---------------|
| **Target Hit** | Some spells (e.g., **Fireball**) terminate upon impact. |
| **Time Expired** | Most spells have a **fixed duration** before disappearing. |
| **Wall Collision** | Most missile spells **end upon hitting walls** or obstacles. |
| **Continuous Effect** | Some spells **persist after hitting targets**, allowing multiple hits (e.g., **Flame Wave, Fire Wall**). |

Additionally, **some spells are blockable**, meaning they can be **negated by a shield block check**. See [Chapter 4.1.2](#) for details on blockable spells.

---

### **Types of Effects**
Each effect belongs to one of the following **damage types**:
- **Fire** (Fireball, Fire Wall)
- **Lightning** (Lightning, Charged Bolt)
- **Magic** (Bone Spirit, Blood Star)
- **Physical (Arrows & Special Cases)**

> ðŸ”¹ **Some effects never deal damage directly**. Examples include **Mana Shield** and **Infravision**, which apply passive effects instead of attacks.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
âœ… **Missile spells** move independently and follow specific rules for impact and duration.  
âœ… **Lightning** consists of **stationary bolts** that **disappear in sequence**, creating the illusion of motion.  
âœ… **Some spells terminate upon impact**, while others **persist and deal repeated damage**.  
âœ… **Each spell belongs to a damage type**, determining **resistances and interactions**.  
âœ… **Blocking applies only to specific spells**, based on their settings.  

---

### 6.1.9 Possible Targets of Attacks

An attack typically **targets a specific location** in the game, with some exceptions. **Normally**, only a **single monster or player** can occupy a given location. However, due to a **bug**, a player and a monster may **end up in the same location**, usually because of the **Teleport** or **Phasing** spell.

If a **player or monster is stationary**, they **can always be attacked**, regardless of what they are doing. However, **certain conditions can make them temporarily immune**, such as:
- **Illusion Weavers retreating**
- **Players entering a new dungeon level (first 0.5 seconds)**

When a **player or monster is moving**, the **location they can be attacked in** depends on the **type of attack** and **walking direction**. The table below summarizes the behavior:

---

### **Target Locations When Walking**
| **Situation** | **NW, N, NE<sup>[^1]</sup>** | **SW, S, SE<sup>[^1]</sup>** | **W, E<sup>[^1]</sup>** |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Player attacking a monster in melee** | Both | Both | Both |
| **Player attacking another player in melee** | Both | Both | Both |
| **Monster attacking a player in melee** | Special<sup>[^2]</sup> | Special<sup>[^2]</sup> | Special<sup>[^2]</sup> |
| **Monster attacking another monster in melee** | Both<sup>[^3]</sup> | Both<sup>[^3]</sup> | Both<sup>[^3]</sup> |
| **Spells<sup>[^4]</sup> hitting a player** | Leaving | Entering | None |
| **Spells<sup>[^4]</sup> hitting monsters (not Stone Cursed)** | Both | Both | Both |
| **Spells<sup>[^4]</sup> hitting Stone Cursed monsters** | Leaving | Entering | None |
| **Fire Wall, Flame Wave, Ring of Fire hitting players/monsters** | Leaving | Entering | None |
| **Hit recovery location (player)** | Leaving | Entering | Leaving |
| **Hit recovery location (monster)** | Leaving | Leaving | Leaving |
| **Location used for distance calculations** | Leaving | Entering<sup>[^5]</sup> | Leaving |

[^1]: **For direction definitions**, refer to **Chapter 1.3**.  
[^2]: **Monsters attacking players** use **a special targeting method** (explained below).  
[^3]: **Monsters attacking other monsters** always check for **To Hit** regardless of the targetâ€™s movement state.  
[^4]: **Excluding Fire Wall, Flame Wave, and Ring of Fire**.  
[^5]: **Distance to a Golem** is **measured to the Leaving location**.

---

### **Special Case: Monsters Attacking Players in Melee**
Unlike **player melee attacks**, **monsters do not specifically check for attack locations**. Instead, **the game calculates the distance between the monster and player**:
- **For the monster**, distance is always measured from **its current location**.
- **For the player**, distance is measured from **a different location depending on movement direction**:
  - **Walking W, NW, N, NE, or E â†’ Distance is measured from the location the player is leaving.**
  - **Walking SW, S, or SE â†’ Distance is measured from the location the player is entering.**

#### **Important Consequences**
- **Walking away (downward movement)**
  - The monster **will always miss** its attack because **To Hit is checked after you have moved**.
- **Walking upwards or sideways**
  - The monster **retains a normal chance to hit** you until you **fully reach the new location**.
- **If an attack interrupts movement**
  - Walking **downward** â†’ The player is **pushed downward**.
  - Walking **in any other direction** â†’ The player is **pushed back into their previous location**.

#### **Monster Decision-Making**
- A **monster will only initiate a melee attack** while you are **walking toward it** **IF** you are walking **SW, S, or SE**.
- If you approach from **NW, N, NE, W, or E**, the monster considers you **non-adjacent** until you have **fully reached an adjacent tile**.

---

### **Bug: Player & Monster Occupying the Same Location**
- **Monsters always check To Hit against a player** in the same location (due to a bug).
- **Players, however, cannot melee attack a monster** in the same locationâ€”only in **adjacent tiles**.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
âœ… **A monsterâ€™s attack accuracy depends on your movement direction.**  
âœ… **Walking downward can cause enemy attacks to miss, while other directions wonâ€™t.**  
âœ… **Hit recovery can shift your final position based on movement direction.**  
âœ… **Players cannot melee attack monsters if they share the same location due to a bug.**  

---

### 6.1.10 Spell and Arrow Speeds

Throughout this guide, **spell and arrow speeds** are given as values ranging from **16 to 63**, rarely below **8**. This section attempts to **convert these values into real dungeon tile speeds**, which is helpful for **estimating the distance penalty of arrows**.

#### **How Missiles Move**
- **Missiles use trigonometric movement calculations** (unlike characters and monsters, which move at a constant speed regardless of direction).
- **Diagonal movement** takes **~40% longer** than movement along a straight axis.
- **Missiles move in small jumps per frame**, meaning:
  - A missile with a **higher speed value moves further per frame**.
  - If a missileâ€™s **per-frame movement is smaller than a tile**, it may **remain in the same location for multiple frames**.
  - Missiles moving at an angle may **clip corners**, never actually "existing" in a tile they pass through.

#### **Missile Precision**
- The game **tracks missile positions with extreme precision**, dividing each tile into **~92,680 Ã— 92,680** smaller sub-units.
- However, for **To Hit calculations**, the missile is only considered to be in a **single tile**.
- Some missile types **only check for hits once per tile**, while others may **attempt multiple hits in the same tile**.

#### **Missile Travel Distance Per Second**
- A missile with **speed = 64** moves **exactly one tile diagonally per frame**.
- This corresponds to **1.4 tiles per frame in a straight direction**.
- A **speed of 45.3** results in **one full tile per frame** in a straight line.

The formula for **missile travel speed (tiles per second)**:
\[
\text{Tiles per second} = \frac{25 \times \text{speed}}{45.3}
\]

---

### **Distance Penalty for Arrows**
Each frame, **arrows accumulate a distance penalty**. The total penalty per **tile traveled** is calculated as:

#### **For Players**:
`distanceÃ—distance/2 = (45.3/speed)Ã—(45.3/speed)/2 = 1 048/(speedÃ—speed)`

#### **For Monsters**:
`distanceÃ—distance = (45.3/speed)Ã—(45.3/speed) = 2 048/(speedÃ—speed)`

---

#### **Important Notes**
- Some **missiles attempt multiple hits per tile**, slightly **increasing actual hit chances** beyond expected values.
- **Missiles do not hit their origin tile**â€”they only start moving from there.
- A missile may take **more than one frame** to enter a new tile if its speed is low.
  
---

### **6.1.11 Notes on Formulas**

- **Which stats apply?**
  - If a formula includes **Dexterity (Dex) or Character Level (clvl)**, it only applies to **players** (monsters do not have these stats).
  - When **players attack players**, or **bonuses apply**, extra **notes clarify** whether a value is taken from the **attacker or defender**.
  - Formulas will specify whether they use **base** or **modified** values (e.g., **base To Hit vs. modified To Hit**).

- **Hellfire-exclusive mechanics** are marked in *italic* throughout the guide.
