All shrines can occur on any dungeon level with the exception of the Enchanted shrine which will only occur on level 1-8. All shrines also have the same probability to occur on any dungeon level. Similarly all shrines have the same probability to be selected when you hit a Goat Shrine or a Cauldron (with the exception of Enchanted shrine mentioned above and the fact that Thaumaturgic Shrines will never appear as a Goat Shrine or a Cauldron).

To make it easier finding out what shrine you have hit when you try your luck at a goat shrine or a cauldron, the table below lists the messages (in alphabetical order) as well as what shrine they correspond to.

1. Message got when someone else uses the shrine.
1. Only available in Hellfire.

There exist a bug that will cause any shrine with a random effect to at times not be random and instead have a specific result. This bug is most noticeable in the first games you play without exiting Diablo completely (decreasing in probability for each dungeon level you enter, including reentering of a level). For the most time, the shrines *will* be random however. The end effect of the bug is that the randomness of those shrines favor a certain result. The favored results are summarized in the table below.

|**Name of shrine**|**Favored result**|**Name of shrine**|**Favored result**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Enchanted Shrine|Chain Lightning losing slvl|Spiritual Shrine|Irrelevant1|
|Hidden Shrine|Shield losing durability|Tainted Shrine|Dexterity increased|
|Mysterious Shrine|Dexterity increased|Murphy’s Shrine2|Second item lose durability|

1. As the shrine typically fills many slots with gold, the end effect will still be quite random depending on number of free slots.
1. Only available in Hellfire.

Due to the way the game work, it may also have some slight impact on random events that are not pre determined by the game (example of pre determined effects are item drops and result of shrines) occurring after the shrine is used. Cauldrons and Goat shrines are *not* affected by this bug.
