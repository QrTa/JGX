# 8. Quests

This chapter deals with all of the quests present in Diablo and Hellfire. It only provides information on what has to be done to fulfill each quest. You have to find the best strategy for doing it yourself. Two of the quests in Hellfire are hidden quests. Chapter 1.2 provides information on how to activate them. Most quests are only available in single player mode, but some are present in both single and multi player. The table below lists each quest and the unique item (if any) you receive when you complete the quest. Normally you get it from the person who initiated the quest. Those unique items are only available in single player and information about them can be found in chapter 3.5. Note that you don’t receive all quests in every game (although some are always present), as they are randomly selected for each game. For more information, see chapter 8.1.

1. In multi player you receive a random magic item instead.

1. Not really a quest but appropriate to list here.

1. Hidden quests, see chapter 1.2 for information on how to activate them.
